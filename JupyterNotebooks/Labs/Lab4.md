This code is super easy to use to modify documents and important files!

While updating the wet_code.py file, many lines of code could be simplified to make the code run more efficiently.
The dollar amounts represented the weekly balance of a user.
Whenever a dollar amount was positive this was a deposit, meaning 15% went to savings, and 85% went to checking.
By using an if, else, statement, allowed the user to change the input in the future for more practical use.
The else statement represented all the other smaller transactions, which would be deducted from savings, or represented by a negative number.
By understanding the practical use of this code allowed for increased efficiency of the code without the redundant lines all equating to the same two end totals.
